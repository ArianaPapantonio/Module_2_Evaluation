# 🗃️ Final Evaluation – Module 2: SQL

This project was completed as part of the **final evaluation for Module 2** of the Adalab Data Analytics Bootcamp.  
It demonstrates the ability to query and analyze data using **SQL**, based on the **Sakila** database, which simulates a movie rental store.

---

## 🎯 Evaluation Objectives

- Write and structure SQL queries to extract and analyze data.
- Apply filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries, and CTEs (Common Table Expressions).
- Solve 23 main exercises + 2 bonus challenges.

---

## 🧱 Database Used: Sakila

Sakila is a sample relational database with tables such as:

- 🎬 **Film** (`film`)
- 👥 **Actors** (`actor`)
- 📋 **Categories** (`category`)
- 👤 **Customers** (`customer`)
- 🛒 **Rentals** (`rental`)
- 📦 **Inventory**, among others

This dataset simulates a real-world business and allows multi-table querying and deep filtering.

---

## 📄 Project Contents

The queries are organized by difficulty level and cover:

- 🔹 **Basic queries**: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `DISTINCT`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`
- 🔹 **Aggregations**: `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- 🔹 **Advanced filtering**: `CASE WHEN`, `LIKE`, `REGEXP`, `NOT IN`
- 🔹 **Table joins**: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`
- 🔹 **Subqueries & CTEs**: to answer complex questions and improve query readability

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- A relational database manager (e.g. **MySQL**)
- A SQL interface like **MySQL Workbench**, **DBeaver**, or similar
- The **Sakila** database installed

## 📓 Notes

- Each query includes inline comments to explain logic and expected results.
- Bonus exercises involve correlated subqueries and advanced use of aggregate functions.
